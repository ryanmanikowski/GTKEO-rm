            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a 21 year old Math Major and Computer Science Minor at Lewis. This is my first year 
            here, yet it feels like home already. I am from New Lenox, Illinois, just 30 minutes down 
            the road from campus. This makes my life easier at times because I am able to see my family 
            which is something important to me. I have two younger siblings, a brother who is a 
            freshman at Mizzou, and a sister who is a junior in High School. My mom and dad both worked 
            extremely hard to make sure that we all were loved and taken care of throughout our 
            lifetime, which makes me feel as if i owe it to them to pay them back for all they have 
            done for us.</p>
            <h3>What I hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>I hope to become comfortable with all platforms of code and have a better understanding 
                of what is being done.</li>
                <li>All different representations of numbers and their meanings</li>
                <li>Make my own code that has some sort of useful mechanism.</li>
            <li>Learn something new every day!</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>My favorite Hobby/Activity</h3>
            <p>As you may be able to see in the photo listed above, I am a baseball player for Lewis and 
            can safely say that I am most passionate about the sport itself. I am always looking for 
            something hard to achieve and for those who have played baseball before know that there is 
            more failure in baseball than there is success. This in mind, it can be a very stressful 
            sport as it leaves you questioning yourself a lot. However, I think the sport of baseball 
            has life imitations in many ways, making it the ultiamte game to either watch or play.</p>
            <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
            <p>Running and Biking are two things that I love to do in my free time. There was one time that
            I had gone roughly 100 miles on bike in a single day with my friend, which was around 5 or
            6 hours of purely biking through the middle of nowhere. </p>
